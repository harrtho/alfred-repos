## Usage

This workflow requires some configuration before use. See [Configuration](#configuration) for
details.

## Configuration

Before you can use this workflow, you have to configure one or more folders in which the workflow
should search for Git repos. The workflow uses `find` to search for `.git` directories, so you
shouldn't add _huge_ directory trees to it, and use the `depth` option to restrict the search depth.
Typically, a `depth` of `2` will be what you want (i.e. search within subdirectories of specified
directory, but no lower). Add directories to search to the `search_dir` array in `settings.json`
(see below).

The default `settings.json` file looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "app_default": "Finder",               // ‚Ü© to open in this/these app(s)
  "app_cmd": "Terminal",                 // ‚åò + ‚Ü© to open in this/these app(s)
  "app_alt": null,                       // ‚å• + ‚Ü© to open in this/these app(s)
  "app_ctrl": null,                      // ^ + ‚Ü© to open in this/these app(s)
  "app_shift": null,                     // ‚áß + ‚Ü© to open in this/these app(s)
  "app_fn": null,                        // fn + ‚Ü© to open in this/these app(s)
  "global_exclude_patterns": [],         // Exclude from all searches
  "search_dirs": [
    {
      "path": "~/delete/this/example",   // Path to search. ~/ is expanded
      "depth": 2,                        // Search subdirs of `path`
      "name_for_parent": 1,              // Name Alfred entry after parent of `.git`. 2 = grandparent of `.git` etc.
      "excludes": [                      // Excludes specific to this path
        "tmp",                           // Directories named `tmp`
        "bad/smell/*"                    // Subdirs of `bad/smell` directory
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This is my `settings.json`:

```javascript
{
  "app_alt": "Fork",
  "app_cmd": "iTerm",
  "app_cmd_alt": [
    "Visual Studio Code",
    "iTerm",
    "Fork",
    "ForkLift"
  ],
  "app_ctrl": "ForkLift",
  "app_default": "Visual Studio Code",
  "app_shift": "Browser",
  "global_exclude_patterns": [],
  "search_dirs": [
    {
      "depth": 2,
      "excludes": [],
      "name_for_parent": 1,
      "path": "~/Development"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** If you specify `Browser`, `Safari`, `Google Chrome`, `Webkit` or `Firefox` as an
application, it will be passed the remote repo URL, not the local filepath. The default remote name
is `origin`. However, you can globally change it to a different remote, such as `upstream`, by using
the `remote_name` setting. `Browser` will open the URL in your default browser.

### Search Directories

Each entry in the `search_dirs` list must be a mapping.

Only `path` is required. `depth` will default to `2` if not specified. `excludes` are globing
patterns, like in `.gitignore`.

`name_for_parent` defaults to `1`, which means the entry in Alfred's results should be named after
the directory containing the `.git` directory. If you want Alfred to show the name of the
grandparent, set `name_for_parent` to `2` etc.

This is useful if your projects are structured, for example, like this and `src` is the actual repo:

```
Code
  Project_1
    src
    other_stuff
  Project_2
    src
    other_stuff
  ‚Ä¶
  ‚Ä¶
```

Set `name_for_parent` to `2`, and `Project_1`, `Project_2` etc. will be shown in Alfred, not `src`,
`src`, `src`‚Ä¶

By default, the cached list of repositories is updated in the background every 3 hours. You can also
change the default update interval (3h ‚Üí 180min) in the
[Workflow Environment Variables][alfred-config-sheet] (the `[ùíô]` icon) in Alfred Preferences. Change
the `UPDATE_EVERY_MINS` workflow variable to suit your needs.

### Open in Applications

The applications specified by the `app_XYZ` options are all called using
`open -a AppName path/to/directory`. You can configure any application that can open a directory in
this manner. Some recommendations are Sublime Text, SourceTree, GitHub or iTerm.

The meta app `Browser` will open the repo's `remote/origin` URL in your default browser. Other
recognized browsers are `Safari`, `Google Chrome`, `Firefox` and `WebKit`.

**Note:** As you can see from my `settings.json`, you can also set an `app_XYZ` value to an array of
applications to open the selected repo in more than one app at once:

```javascript
‚Ä¶
  "app_cmd": ["Visual Studio Code", "iTerm", "Fork", "ForkLift"],
‚Ä¶
```

You can also arbitrarily combine modifiers to give yourself many more options:

```javascript
"app_cmd_alt": "Finder",
"app_shift_alt_cmd": "VSCodium",
"app_cmd_fn_alt": "Oni",
etc.
etc.
```

Modifiers may be specified in any order. The only requirements are that the key must start with
`app_` and the modifiers must be separated by `_`.

You can also use `‚Üí` on a result to access Alfred's default File Actions menu.

### Change Repository Icons

You can set an icon for all repositories that share the same parent directory.
Simply add an icon file named `.alfred-repos-icon.png` to the parent directory of the repositories. The icon will then appear in Alfred's results.
If no icon is found, the default icon will be displayed.
